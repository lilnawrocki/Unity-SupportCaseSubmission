[itch.io - Support Case Submission](https://lilnawrocki.itch.io/support-case-submission)

Password: MN_AC_92

A simple application built in Unity with C# that simulates a case submission portal. Users can submit a new support case by filling out a form with key details such as title, priority, and description. The support case form has an autofill button that automatically populates the submission form with predefined sample data for quick testing and demonstration purposes. Submitted cases are added to a queue of open cases and displayed in a list. Each case includes: Case Title, Submission Date, Priority Level, Case ID. Clicking an open case displays its details in a dedicated panel for preview and review. Cases can be resolved via a Close/Resolve button, which removes them from the open queue.
